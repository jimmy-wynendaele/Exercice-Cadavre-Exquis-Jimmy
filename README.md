## * Hi there! *

This is the story of a bird from a place far away.The bird was born blind. This story is about how he made his way through life.

Jimmy, as the bird was named, was not only blind. He was the biggest, fattest ostrich ever.

It was a large lovely garden,

with soft green grass.

 Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars,

 I'm in love with a shooting star

But she moves so fast

When she falls then

I'll be waiting
